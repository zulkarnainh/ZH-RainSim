**ZH-RainSim** is a standalone desktop tool designed for downscaling Global Climate Model (GCM) data. It generates future rainfall ensembles using a Markov Chain occurrence model coupled with a Gamma distribution for intensity.

This tool simplifies the process of simulating daily rainfall series for hydrological and hydraulic impact assessments under various climate scenarios (e.g., SSP5-8.5).
